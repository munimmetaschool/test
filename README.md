This course is for beginner web3 developers who wish to learn about Avalanche blockchain and how they can deploy the smart contracts on it. You should have a basic knowledge of blockchain, [consensus mechanism](https://external.ink?to=/metaschool.so/articles/consensus-mechanism-meaning/), and Solidity Programming language because in this course we will focus more on writing ERC20 token and deploying it on Avalanche blockchain.
